# Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for Laboratories

The *disel* project (Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for 
Laboraoties) aims to create an environment that will allow students to 
concentrate on conceptual aspects of prgramming by providing a set of 
pre-installed and pre-configured developement (and assessment) tools.
