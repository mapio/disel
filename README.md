# Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for Laboratories

The **disel** framweork (Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for Laboraoties) aims to create an environment that will allow students to concentrate on *conceptual aspects of prgramming* by providing a set of pre-installed and pre-configured developement (and assessment) tools.

Please, see the [wiki](https://github.com/mapio/disel/wiki/) for some preliminary desing documents.

Any **help will be appreciated**, if you want to collaborate (to the *desing*, *developement*, or *testing* phase) feel free to [fork](https://github.com/mapio/disel/fork_select) and request a *pull* if you feel so inclined.
