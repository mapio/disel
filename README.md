# Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for Laboratories

The **disel** framweork (Department of Informatics Simplified Environment for Laboraoties) aims to create an environment that will allow computer science students to concentrate on *conceptual aspects of prgramming* by providing a simplified developement environment.

This framework wants to make *easy* (and *fun*) for students to **practice** programming by hiding the technical details usually involved in setting up (installing and configuring) the development (and *testing*) toolchain and using its complex and diverse tools.

Even if the proficiency with the *command line* and the ability to manage and use complex software are *very important (and unavoidable) skills* of a computer science student, we believe that imposing such requirements to first year programming classes often *tends to hide the conceptual aspects* of the discipline and *discourages from practicing* â€“ a more disastrous outcome than delaying the achievement of more technical skills.

## Design phase 

The project is in a *design* phase, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/mapio/disel/wiki/) for some very preliminary draft.

Any **help will be appreciated**, if you want to collaborate (to the *desing*, *developement*, or *testing* phase) feel free to [fork](https://github.com/mapio/disel/fork_select) and request a *pull* if you feel so inclined.
